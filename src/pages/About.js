          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            Open Education Uganda was founded in 2020 by the Director Najuna Brian with the goal of breaking down barriers to education.
            We believe every Ugandan student deserves access to high-quality learning resources, regardless
            of their institution or financial situation. He then got the Architect of the mission, Jerry Laruba Festus to begin setting the plans in motion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through partnerships with universities, educators, and technology experts, we've built a platform
            that brings together the best educational content from universities across the entire country.
